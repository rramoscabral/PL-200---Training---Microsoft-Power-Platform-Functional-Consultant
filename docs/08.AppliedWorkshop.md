# Applied Workshop: PL-200 Power Platform Functional Consultant


## Workshop overview

In this workshop, you will create your own solution to the stated problems.

This workshop is open-ended by design. Use this time to practice what you need, and don’t be afraid to use
your trainer for help when you get stuck.

You will need to evaluate the requirements and build the solutions and automation as required. Think of
this like building a functioning proof of concept. The data model has been defined for you, but the specifics
of the apps are left to you to design. Make sure you design with users top of mind for a good experience
that meets the stated requirements.

If time allows, you will have a chance to share your solution with your peers for review and feedback.

**Note:** You are only completing one scenario. We’ve given you three to choose from. Review them and
choose the one you’d like to build.

## Time management

You have a day to complete all aspects of this assignment. Review all the expectations first, then begin to manage your time. Phase 1 is designed to be a small group discussion, however if you are working solo then take the time to brainstorm on your own to help you with the rest of the assignment. Most of your time should be spent in Phases 2 and 3. Your instructor will let you know when to start Phase 4, but plan for it to take about 6 0 minutes of your time.

Plan for the following:
- Phase 1: Small group discussion (15 min)
- Phase 2: Design your solution (60 min)
- Phase 3: Build your solution (180 min)
- Phase 4: Share and compare your solutions (60 min)


    ![Plan your time image](../files/Plan_your_time.png)


### Phase 1: Small group discussion

Discuss with your small group the idea of building the solution. Have a brainstorming session about how you might approach the requirements.

#### Discussion points

- Which scenario did you choose?
- Do you know what you need to build?
- Are there any distractors or irrelevant information offered?

### Phase 2: Design your solution

Now you should plan how you will approach the solution. Put pen to paper (or digital, or whatever works for
you) and make your to-do list.

#### Considerations

- Do you know where information should be entered for each item?
- What automation will you include?

### Phase 3: Build your solution

Time to make your solution.

#### Considerations

- Do you have the information needed to complete the required elements?
- Do you need to make assumptions to accommodate for vague requirements?
- Do you have enough time to complete all tasks?

### Phase 4: Share and compare your solution

Share your solution with your small group. Compare the experience. Can you export your solution and
import it to another environment.

#### Considerations

- How do others’ solutions compare to yours? What is similar? What is different?
- How would you improve your solution?
- What did you learn?


### Requirements

Here are the details for each of the three scenarios. Remember that you are only completing this project
